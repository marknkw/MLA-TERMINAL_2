# MONAD_Virtual_Assistant
 Automation devices - like virtual-downloadable, and in-situ virtual assistants - are the first solution for newer adopters of home automation. The cheapest go-to solution available, right now, is Amazon echo, that cost around BRL200 or US$50 - i.e. for the second generation. With these being said, one thing comes to mind for the wanna-doer-DIY-self-taught-engineer: why not architect, and build, my own virtual assistant? Well... That's what I'll be trying here.
